# Form Filler – Sample Project

## Setup

1.  Make sure you've worked through the prep guide to install the necessary
    prerequisites – Node.js and npm/yarn. If you're using yarn, replace
    `npm` / `npm run` with `yarn` in the commands below.
2.  Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies for this
    project.
3.  Run `npm run test:unit` to make sure the tests are passing.
4.  Run `npm run serve` to start a server on `localhost:8080`. Make sure there are
    no warnings or errors before you get started.
5.  Visit `localhost:8080` and try out the current form.

We have provided [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and TSLint configurations if
you want to configure your editor to automatically format your code in the right
style. These configurations are identical to the real exercise.

If you run into any issues out of the box, please let us know!
